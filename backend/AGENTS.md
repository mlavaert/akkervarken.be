# Guidelines

## Design

- Choose minimalism over everything
- Never add properties that are not explicitly asked for

## HTML

- Use native HTML elements over adding classes to everything

## Python

- Formatting should be done using Ruff. Execute `ruff format .` to format the entire codebase
- Linting is also executed using Ruff. Execute `ruff check --fix . ` to fix the entire codebase
